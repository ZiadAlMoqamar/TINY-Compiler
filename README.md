# TinyParser

## Introduction

A parser is a compiler/interpreter component which is responsible for producing parser tree or abstract syntax tree.
In this repo, my goal is to write a Tiny Parser using a predictive top-down parsing technique â€” recursive descent technique.

## To-dos

- [x] convert grammar rules to the EBNF notation.
- [ ] create boilerplate parser.
- [ ] write helpful classes and functions: trees,match,computational fns,...etc.
- [ ] implement the parser.
- [ ] implement errors.

### Grammar rules in EBNF

- program -> stmt-seq
- stmt-seq -> stmt{;stmt}
- stmt -> if-stmt | repeat-stmt | assign-stmt | read-stmt | write-stmt
- if-stmt -> if exp then stmt-seq [else stmt-seq] end
- repeat-stmt -> repeat stmt-seq until exp
- assign-stmt -> identifier := exp
- read-stmt -> read identifier
- write-stmt -> write exp
- exp -> simple-exp [comparison-op simple-exp]
- comparison-op -> < | =
- simple-exp -> term {addop term}
- addop -> + | -
- term -> factor {mulop factor}
- mulop -> \* | /
- factor -> (exp) | number | identifier

### Notes

- statement has neighor nodes and child nodes
- statement is rectangle
- operation is binary tree
- operation is ellipse
